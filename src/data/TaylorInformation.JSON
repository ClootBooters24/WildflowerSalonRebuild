With about 5 years of experience, I've become a pro at understanding different hair types and textures, and I love helping clients find their perfect style. Whether you're looking for a trendy haircut or a gorgeous color transformation, I'm here to collaborate and make your hair dreams come true. My specializations include vivid color, extensions (for both hair and lashes), and custom-tailored cuts. However, I'm passionate about all things beauty. I even love to perform corrective colors and cuts. I'm always staying up-to-date on the latest trends and techniques so you can be sure you're getting the best possible service. Let's chat about your hair goals and have some fun along the way!",
