    "about": "I am a creative and well-experienced hairstylist from central Illinois that relocated to Northwest Arkansas in spring of 2023. Recently married, I enjoy outdoor adventuring with my husband when not in the salon. I have always been drawn to natural beauty and the diversity of color, texture and style of all things, especially in humans. I strive to customize every service for each client that sits in my chair, finding out their likes and dislikes about their hair; learning their styling preferences to better create the ideal style for them. I love to accentuate natural features and textures through both my color and cuts. One of my favorite aspects of being a stylist is the personal connections I make along the way. I love people, I enjoy meeting new faces and hearing other people's stories.",
