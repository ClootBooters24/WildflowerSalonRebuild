    "about": "A passionate hairstylist with a fresh perspective and a love for helping people feel their best. I specialize in blowouts, precision cuts, and lived in color, and I’m always staying on top of the latest trends and techniques. I believe great hair starts with a great conversation, and I’m here to listen, collaborate, and bring your vision to life. When I’m not behind the chair, I enjoy spending time with family and friends. I am a mom to the most perfect baby girl, so I’m obsessed with hanging out with her! I also love anything to do with being outdoors! If you’re ready for a new stylist who’s excited to grow with you, I’d love to meet you. Let’s create something beautiful together!",
